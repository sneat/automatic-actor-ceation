# Automatic Actor Creator

Created in response to a [Reddit request](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundryVTT/comments/swh315/module_to_automatically_create_one_actor_for_a/).

Requires a GM to be logged into the world to allow the Actor to be created.

When a player joins the game, if they don't already own an Actor, one is created with their name.
